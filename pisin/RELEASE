### The Desktop Components

- Operating System: Raspberry Pi OS Lite release (it is now Debian Bookworm 12.12). Not yet tested on Trixie.
- Window Manager: this is Window Maker 0.95.9 (debian default package version) with PISIN.themed and options: --no-dock  --no-clip --static. Some apps and tools are launched with the 'autostart' script of Window Maker.
	 (MEMO: 0.96.0 was broken: "symbol lookup error: wuserdatapath": unresolved until now, so we reverted to previous stable version)
- Notifyer: dunst - SimpleAgenda won't use it because libDBUSKit is not installed.
- Compositing: compton.
- Sys Infos: conky. Weather data is fetched from Wttr.in. The system monitoring is upon: date, time, uptime, CPU, Memory, Storage and Networking.
	(Conky Panel is localized in French and in English)

- GNUstep: latest built from sources with GNU Runtime (not OBJC2). Use: `pisin --info` for a more complete release info.
All the apps below were built from sources and so are the latest.
- Preferences Manager: SystemPreferences
- Workspace: GWorkspace and Recycler: 1.1.0 (02 2025) - Its own Desktop layer and its Dock (modern flavour) are shown. The Wallpaper is shown on this layer. It is a mandatory set to manage mounted removable devices on the Desktop and to unmount those by DND on the Recycler Icon.
- Theme: PISIN mostly inspired by Papirus Icon theme and GNUstep Sleek Theme: finished.
- Session: Display Manager (Lightdm) and DBus (but without DBUSKit).
- Alsa compliant Audio Mixer: see VolumeControl below.
- RPI tools: wrappers for rpi-imager, rpinters.
