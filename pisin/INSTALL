# PiStep Initiative Desktop (PiSiN)

## How to install (from SOURCES)

### Base OS and Locale

1) With the 'rpi-imager' tool, copy the '64-bit Raspberry Pi OS Lite' (without desktop) on an SD card (16 GB required): i.e.: Debian Trixie (13) --- You should customize the keyboard layout, the user name and his password...   

2) Plug the SD card, remove any USB connected device and boot your Pi with this Operating System. 

3) After the usual first auto-reboot, log in and update the Debian OS:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

You should get the latest release: 13.1 as shown by:
	
	cat /etc/debian_version

4) Enable and install your desired locale:

- Uncomment your locale in '/etc/locale.gen':

	sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

- Generate your locale:

	sudo locale-gen

- Set your locale (adapt the command below to your locale):

	sudo localectl set-locale fr_FR.UTF-8

- Log out and Log in again to apply the new locale in your context.
- Verify the locale is correctly set:

	locale

- **Nota**: until now, installation scripts are only in English. i18n of PiSin depends of the state of the respective translations of the apps in the GNUstep project. For the Conky Panel, French and English are available now.

### Prerequisites

- Install 'git':

	sudo apt install git

- Add a 'SOURCES' directory to build all is needed:

	mkdir SOURCES && cd SOURCES

- Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/pcardona34/pi-step-initiative.git
	cd pi-step-initiative/pisin


### Start All-in-One install script

This script should work on well tested Pi's SBC: Models 3B, 400, 4B.

	./enjoy.sh

You can see progress and info messages while PiSiN is installing.
After several minutes, you should be able to start the PiSiN Desktop with 'startx'. 


If all is ok, logout and install the Display Manager (lightdm):

	./7_install_DM.sh

Now, after every login, the Desktop will be launched.

TIP: If you need to use CLI again, use TTY2 to login to the console: CTRL-ALT-F2.
	
---

If the above 'enjoy.sh' script failed for some reason, try the following manual steps to note the issue concerned:

### Prepare the installation (mainly build tools on debian dependencies)
	
(i) Tip: the point './' below means to search and execute the script in the current directory:

	./1_prep.sh

### Install Window Maker

	./2_install_wmaker.sh

### Install the Core GNUstep

	./3_install_gnustep.sh	
	
### Install the Frameworks

	./4_install_frameworks.sh

### Start the main installation script with the 'apps' option.

	./5_install_PISIN.sh apps

If all is ok, you can run the same command with each option: 'devel', 'extra' and 'games'.

### Set the current user's environment and PISI theme

	./6_user_settings.sh

IMPORTANT! Step 6 must be run after every new step 5.
	
### Start the X server and PiSiN Desktop:
	
	cd && startx

## CAUTION!

/!\ Do not install any GNUstep deb package: this would conflict with the GNUstep built by PiSiN and break your Desktop.

### Notes

- If you want to regenerate your default user's setting, log out the Desktop and do that:
	cd && rm -fR GNUstep
	cd SOURCES/pi-step_initiative/pisin
	./6_user_settings.sh

### If all is right, logout and install the Display Manager:

	./7_install_DM.sh
