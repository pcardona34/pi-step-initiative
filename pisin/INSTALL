# PiStep Initiative Desktop (PiSiN)

## How to install

### Base OS and Locale

1) Create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS Lite 64bit Bookworm (12) (no desktop)   
and then boot with this system.

2) Update the Debian OS:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade

3) Enable and install your desired locale:

- Uncomment your locale in '/etc/locale.gen':

	sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

- Generate your locale:

	sudo locale-gen

- Set your locale (adapt the command below to your locale):

	sudo localectl set-locale fr_FR.UTF-8

- Log out and Log in again to apply the new locale in your context.
- Verify the locale is correctly set:

	locale

- **Nota**: until now, installation scripts are only in English. i18n of PiSin depends of the state of the respective translations of the apps in the GNUstep project. For the Conky Panel, French and English are available now.

### Prerequisites

- Install 'git':

	sudo apt install git

- Add a 'SOURCES' directory to build all is needed:

	mkdir SOURCES && cd SOURCES

- Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/pcardona34/pi-step-initiative.git
	cd pi-step-initiative/pisin

### Prepare the installation (mainly debian dependencies)
	
(i) Tip: the point './' below means to search and execute the script in the current directory:

	./1_prep.sh

### Install the Core GNUstep

	./2_install_GNUstep.sh	
	
### Start the main installation script

	./3_install_PISIN.sh

This will show you an help message to select your OPTION installation: 'desktop', then 'apps' are mandatory.

### Set the current user's environment and PISI theme

	./4_user_settings.sh
	
N.B.: If you want to regenerate your default user's setting, log out the Desktop and do that:
	cd && rm -fR GNUstep
	cd SOURCES/pi-step_initiative/pisin
	./4_user_settings.sh
	
### Start the X server and PiSiN Desktop:
	
	cd && startx

Enjoy!

## CAUTION!

/!\ Until now, there is no Graphic GNUstep Login Manager.
!!! DO NOT install 'wdm' session manager, because the WINGS libs dependencies 
would conflict with those already installed by PiSiN Desktop.
And do not install any GNUstep deb package for the same reason.
