		<section name="The Vertical Menu">

		It is the menu of the active application. If you launch another application or if you click on the Window of another application, this application becomes active and its menu shows in place of the previous one.

		<br>A simple menu item is a command inside the active application. If a shortcut key is shown a the right of this item, you can use it as an alternative.
		<br>The symbol <b>#</b> &nbsp;before a letter means to push down and hold the  'Command' key as a prefix.<br>
 
		<caution>
 On a Pi keyboard, the 'Command' key is the <b>left Alt</b> &nbsp;key as on almost the PC running a GNU/Linux operating system. It is <b>not</b> &nbsp;the 'Pi' key.
		</caution>

		<br>The <b>arrow</b> &nbsp;at the right of an item suggests a submenu.

		</section>


		<section name="The Dock">
		It is the vertical panel at the left: icons of the favorite applications are yet placed on the Dock. In this context, those are also named <b>appicons</b> &nbsp;and the relevant applications are so called 'docked' apps. The first one at the top of the Dock is <b>GWorkspace</b>, which manages the whole workspace. The last one, at the bottom, is the <b>Recycler</b>, which namely manages the Trash Folder.<br>

	<information>
	Tip: if you let the mouse pointer a few seconds over an appicon, you will see a tag with the name of that application.
	<br>&nbsp;
	</information>

<br>The <b>three dots</b> &nbsp;under an appicon mean that this applicaion has not been launched yet. <b>One click</b> &nbsp;on an appicon allows you to start this app from the Dock or to make it active if it was already launched.

		</section>

<br>If you launch an application from another place (i.e: the Applications window, the Tabshelf...) its appicon will appear on the Dock, but it will be removed at the end of the current session. If a launched application is inactive, you will see a <b>single dot</b> &nbsp;under the appicon.
