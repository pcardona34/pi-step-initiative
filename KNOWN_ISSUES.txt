Known Issues
==========================

# Release: 0.1-Alpha

- Session: After GWorkspace is closed, exiting with the menu of Window Maker will often restart the window manager instead of exiting. Maybe related to WMState?  
- [x] Reported to Window Maker at Github repo.
- N.B.: if you wait a few seconds after closing GWorkspace, the issue does never happen.

- Dock: DND of a document from GWorkspace onto a docked app will not open this. You must first launch the app, and then DND is working.
Case with: TextEdit

- SimpleAgenda: alarms do not function. Reported to P.O.Roussel in the Discuss List.
