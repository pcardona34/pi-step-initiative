# PiStep Initiative Desktop (PISI)

## How to install

### Base OS and Locale

1) Create an SD card with the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (no desktop)   
and then boot with this system.

2) Update the Debian OS:

	sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade

3) Enable and install your desired locale:

- Uncomment your locale in '/etc/locale.gen':

	sudo nano /etc/locale.gen

- Generate your locale:

	sudo locale-gen

- Set your locale (adapt the command below to your locale):

	sudo localectl set-locale fr_FR.UTF-8

- Exit and Log in again to apply the new locale in your context.
- Verify the locale is correctly set:

	locale

### Prerequisites

- Install 'git':

	sudo apt install git

- Add a 'SOURCES' directory to build all is needed:

	mkdir SOURCES && cd SOURCES

- Clone this repository:

	git clone https://github.com/pcardona34/pi-step-initiative.git
	cd pi-step-initiative/pisi

### Prepare the installation
	
(i) Tip: the point './' below means to search and execute the script in the current directory:

	./1_prep.sh
	
### Start the main installation script

	./2_install_PISI.sh

This will show you an help message to select your OPTION installation.

### Set the current user's environment

	./3_user_settings.sh
	
N.B.: when you will regenerate your default user's setting, log out the Desktop and do that:
	cd && rm -fR GNUstep
	cd SOURCES/pi-step_initiative/pisi
	./3_user_settings.sh
	
### Start the X server and PiSi Desktop
	
	cd
	startx

Enjoy!

## CAUTION!

/!\ Until now, there is no GNUstep Login Manager.
!!! DO NOT install 'wdm' session manager, because the WINGS libs dependencies 
would conflict with those already installed by PiSi Desktop.
