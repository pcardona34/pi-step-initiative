### Sound must work!

- [x] Tested: ALSA conf
- [x] Document the method (.help) to set ALSA working and also the Mixer app.

### Agenda notifications

- [x] See again exchange with poroussel and issue notes. => Notifications depend on 'libs-dbuskit', but the insallation of this framework still fails. Help needed! In conflict with the choice of the GNU Runtime VS libobjc2.

In the meanwhile, using 'BithNotify' set of tools.

### Testing some features / PiSiN DEMO

- [x] Better Theme: enhancing PISIN Theme (read again GNUstep Discuss List) with help from Sleek Theme.
- [ ] Syncing subdirs within StepSync
- [x] What are these GSMarkupBrowser and GSLocalizableStrings? Answer: dev tools related to the Renaissance Framework.
- [x] MDFinder is not Finder? Obviously not. It is a MetaData Finder.

#### Testing within SAMPLES

- [x] Create a 'SAMPLES' Folder
- [x] Make Testing Units Log (better logs): install of GNUstep Core has been detached and refined.
- [x] To be extended: completed.

### Misc Migrating Tools and procedures

- [ ] Target: SimpleAgenda. A way to import TODO.txt with an .ics intermediate converter.
- [x] Target: AddressManager. A way to import a Birthday list with a .vcf intermediate converter: done with 'birth2vcf'.
- [ ] Target: a GSPass (frontend to create) with Pass. In the meanwhile, using 'pass' in the Terminal.
- [x] A way to import from a .csv (see export of the Password Manager of Chromium; and also from KeePassXC) passwords database. Already provided by pass.
- [x] Target: AddressManager: import a .vcf directory from Abook. Test ok.
- [-] Documentation about each process: done for Birthdays and feasts.

### Tools a Pi average user should look for

- [x] a Mixer: must be AlsaMixer compliant, because it is the way the sound is managed under RPI Lite OS (no PulseAudio) --> VolumControl is ok
- [x] Debian (RPI OS) Updater (notifying applet) -- via the notifications (dunst). It is now in the TOOLS Folder: pisin_updater. Verity the installation is added to (user_settings?) - deps: dunst.
- [ ] PiSiN Updater: info about a new PiSiN release or an app update. Idem. Todo: extend pisin_updater to include this.
- [ ] Recommended Software (easy way to install/uninstall each extra app)
- [-] EPub reader to include within Librarian and document convert tools... See in the meanwhile the wrapper EBookReader.app.
- [-] A Password Manager Web Browser free (see Pass, it's C )...

### Misc apps for a French User

- [ ] Lookup words from French Dictionaries like Littr√©, etc.
- [ ] Localization for all the base...: to French (audit begun)

### Average User Documentation

- [x] Help: should be within HelpViewer (.help/.xlp format)
- [x] How to Login / start Workspace / halt pi400: not needed using LightDM now.
- [ ] Customization: locales, timezone (launching and using SystemPreferences)
- [x] How to use GWorkspace (basic operations on Files); mount/unmount a removable device...
- [-] Setting CUPS (printing): see Rpinters wrapper on PiSiN and Setup_Printer on AGNoStep.
- [x] Setting/Fixing AlsaMixer
- [ ] setting/Using Librarian
- [ ] An Application Quick Tour
- [x] About Notifications: Updater, BirthNotify. See PiSiN UG.

### Developer Documentation

- [ ] Maybe more in the Librarian app, because there are PDF tutos...
- [ ] What is GNUstep? What it is not.
- [ ] Making tools, scripting (StepTalk)
- [ ] Making an app (tutorial) with PC and Gorm

- [x] Create a Significative Wallpaper for the screenshots
- [x] Icon for StepSync
- [x] Better icon for InnerSpace

## New candidates to Extra apps?

- [x] Inkscape
- [x] EBookReader (FBReader)

---

### DRAFTS

There are the failed builds, the tests before choosing, etc.

- [-] A well integrated WebBrowser (High priority): 
  - see repo 'netsurf-gnustep' (by Anthonyc-r at Github) which embeds Netsurf 3.10: but does not use javascript
a build issue has been posted on the repo's owner. Moved to DRAFT. See there.
  - gs-WebBrowser (by Onflapp at Github) embeds Chromium, it was successfully built, but the Web pages do not load: due to an evolution of Chromium.
  [x] In the meanwhile, using a wrapper of Chromium.
- [x] NetSurf (wait: issue has been addressed by Anthony RC... See https://github.com/anthonyc-r/netsurf-gnustep/issues/2 - Removed due to Javascript missing feature.
- [-] NeXTGo
- [-] OpenOutliner: to be tested again...

## Future releases

- [ ] Test on a Pi 500 (January 2026)
- [ ] List needed changes and evolutions for the Pi 500
