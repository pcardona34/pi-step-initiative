### Testing some features / PiSi DEMO

- [x] Better Theme: enhancing PISIN Theme (read again GNUstep Discuss List) with help from Sleek Theme.

- [ ] Target: a GSPass (frontend to create) with Pass. A way to import from a .csv (see export of the Password Manager of Chromium; and also from KeePassXC) passwords database.
- [x] Target: AddressManager: import a .vcf directory from Abook. Test ok.
- [ ] Documentation about each process.

### Tools a Pi average user should look for

- [x] a Mixer: must be AlsaMixer compliant, because it is the way the sound is managed under RPI Lite OS (no PulseAudio) --> VolumControl
- [x] Debian (RPI OS) Updater (notifying applet) -- via the notifications (dunst). It is now in the TOOLS Folder: pisin_updater. Verity the installation is added to (user_settings?) - deps: dunst & libnotify-bin

- [ ] Recommended Software (easy way to install/uninstall each extra app)
- [-] EPub reader to include within Librarian and document convert tools... See in the meanwhile the wrapper EBookReader.app.
- [-] A Password Manager Web Browser free (see Pass, it's C or in the meanwhile, a dockapp like WMpasman) | in the meanwhile, use of Chromium password manager...

See there. || Alternative: gs-WebBrowser (by Onflapp at Github) embeds Chromium, it was successfully built, but the Web pages do not load... Something is missing, but not documented.
