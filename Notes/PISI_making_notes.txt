## To understand the way and the matter

This is a Desktop built from the latest sources of WindowMaker and the 
GNUstep environment. Although it is on Debian OS Lite (Bookworm), it does not
use any deb package of GNUstep nor of WindowMaker, because those are 
often outdated. So all of those are fetched out of the Debian apt repo
and built from their own respective sources, mostly from Github or Savannah.

It has been first tested on and conceived for the Raspberry Pi 400 Model (not yet tested on a Pi500: if you did, so let me know) and with 
an HD monitor connected at the HDMI port (my current resolution is 1920x1080).

I am using a wired network connection, so I do not care about WiFi. If you need it, use the native RPI CLI tools to get a working connection.
This is mandatory, because we need to download many things to go on.

Do not be afraid about building: all is made by the scripts provided within this repo.
Those scripts will do the following steps:

- Preparing the environment: fetching and installing dependencies on Debian.
- Fetching and building every piece of software: libs, frameworks and applications.
- Setting the User Desktop profile and the PISI Theme.

Behind all of these projects are or were people who contributed to the spirit of the Free Software, I mean let others study their code to learn and practice. The most eminent is the Free Software Foundation:

I have a grateful thought about some of them who sadely passed: Enrico Sersale, who brought to us GWorkspace, inspired by the NeXT Workspace, and Bertrand Dekoninck, who demonstrated that GNUstep theming makes avaible a beautiful and modern Desktop, accomplishing the premise of the discontinued Étoilé project.
